--------------

+ [DAML Assistant] **BREAKING CHANGE** Changed the meaning of the ``source`` field in the daml.yaml
  file to be a pointer to the source directory of the DAML code contained in a project relative to
  the project root. This is breaking projects, where the ``source`` field of the project is pointing
  to a non-toplevel location in the source code directory structure.
+ [DAML Standard Library] Add a new ``div`` operator for integer
  division. The ``Fractional`` instance of ``Int`` and thereby using
  ``/`` on ``Int`` is deprecated and the instance will be removed in
  SDK 0.13.25.
